# Advanced Problem Solving – C++ Implementation

---

## 📌 Course Overview

In this course, I solved 50 algorithmic and mathematical problems using C++.

Unlike previous stages where I focused only on logic or syntax separately, this stage required combining:

- Algorithmic thinking  
- Clean C++ implementation  
- Reusable function design  
- Basic library structuring  

Instead of keeping each solution isolated, I collected and refactored many of them into a small utility-style library.

This course represents a shift from writing standalone solutions to building reusable structured components.

## 🧠 What I Learned

### 1️⃣ Translating Logic into Structured Code

- Converting algorithmic ideas into clean, readable functions  
- Breaking large problems into smaller reusable units  
- Reducing repetition through modular design  

---

### 2️⃣ Building Reusable Utilities

I implemented custom versions of common mathematical operations without relying on `<cmath>`:

- Custom `ceil`, `floor`, and `round`  
- Absolute value  
- Power (recursion-based)  
- Factorial  
- Prime checking  
- Odd / Even detection  

This helped me understand how built-in functions work internally instead of just using them.

---

### 3️⃣ Working with Geometry Formulas

Implemented area and perimeter calculations for:

- Rectangle  
- Triangle  
- Circle (multiple calculation variations)  

This strengthened my understanding of mathematical formulas and numeric precision handling.

---

### 4️⃣ Array-Based Problem Solving

Practiced solving problems involving arrays:

- Finding maximum / minimum values  
- Calculating sum and average  
- Searching for specific values  
- Copying arrays  
- Checking if an array is a palindrome  
- Shuffling arrays using templates  

This improved my loop control, indexing accuracy, and structured thinking.

---

### 5️⃣ Randomization & String Generation

Built small utilities for:

- Random number generation  
- Generating characters (letters, digits, symbols)  
- Creating random words  
- Generating license-style keys  
- Filling arrays with random data  

This improved my understanding of ASCII manipulation and randomness logic.

---

### 6️⃣ Basic Encryption Concept

Implemented a simple character-shift encryption/decryption system to practice:

- ASCII operations  
- Looping over strings correctly  
- Understanding character encoding basics  

---

## 🏗 Design Approach

While solving the problems, I focused on structuring the code professionally:

- Used `namespace` for logical grouping  
- Applied function overloading  
- Used `enum` for clarity  
- Implemented template functions for generic operations  
- Prioritized readability and structure over performance optimization  

This stage marks my transition from solving isolated exercises to building structured reusable tools.

## 🚀 Projects Built During This Course

During this stage, I also built two practical console-based projects applying the same concepts learned here.

These projects are available in a separate repository:

🔗 **Core Concepts Projects (C++)**  
[basics/math-quiz]

The projects demonstrate:

- Structured programming practices  
- Multi-file organization  
- Reusable utility usage  
- Real-world problem simulation  

They reflect my transition from solving exercises to building complete applications.

## 🎯 Key Outcome

After completing this course, I am able to:

- Think algorithmically before writing code  
- Structure solutions cleanly  
- Build reusable helper utilities  
- Understand the internal logic of common mathematical operations  
- Solve problems confidently with less trial-and-error
