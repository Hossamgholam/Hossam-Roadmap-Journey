```

Examples:

* String splitting
* Date formatting
* Input validation
* Random generation

---

# 💾 Data Storage

The system uses **text files as a simple database**.

Files used:

```
Clients.txt
Users.txt
TransferLog.txt
LoginRegister.txt
```

---

## Clients File Format

```
FirstName#//#LastName#//#Email#//#Phone#//#AccountNumber#//#PinCode#//#Balance
