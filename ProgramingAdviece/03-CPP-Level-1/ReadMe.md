# 03 – Introduction to Programming with C++ – Level 1

## 📚 Course Overview

This course is the first programming course in my journey where I applied all the thinking and problem-solving skills I learned in previous courses using C++.

It focused on **turning logical thinking into real code**, covering:

- Variables and Data Types
- Operators and Expressions
- Input/Output using `cin` and `cout`
- Conditional Statements (`if`, `switch`)
- Loops (`for`, `while`, nested loops)
- Functions (with and without return values)
- Scope (local vs global variables)
- Arrays
- Structures (`struct`) and Enumerations (`enum`)
- Casting and Type Conversion
- Strings and String Operations

## 🧠 Key Concepts Learned

### 1. Procedural Programming
- Writing structured programs
- Using functions to separate logic
- Passing variables by value vs reference

### 2. Data Types & Variables
- Fundamental types: `int`, `float`, `double`, `char`, `bool`, `string`, `wchar_t`
- Derived types: arrays, pointers, references
- User-defined types: `struct`, `enum`, `union`, `typedef`
- Variable naming rules (case-sensitive, letters/numbers/underscores, no special characters at start)

### 3. Operators & Math Functions
- Arithmetic, relational, logical, assignment operators
- Math functions: `sqrt()`, `pow()`, `abs()`, `ceil()`, `round()`, `floor()`

### 4. Control Flow
- Conditional statements (`if`, `else`, `switch`)
- Loops (`for`, `while`, nested loops)
- Breaking down logic into step-by-step processing

### 5. Functions
- Procedural functions (`void`) and functions returning values
- Reusability and modular design
- Scope management (local and global variables)
- Passing arguments by value or reference

### 6. Structures & Enums
- Grouping related variables using `struct`
- Defining constants with `enum`
- Nested structures
- Printing and managing structured data

### 7. Strings & Casting
- String input/output
- Concatenation (`+`)
- Length and character access (`s.length()`, `s[i]`)
- Converting strings to numbers (`stoi`, `stof`, `stod`)
- Converting numbers to strings (`to_string`)

## 🎯 Key Practices & Mini-Projects

- Printing user information using functions
- Drawing patterns with loops
- Summation exercises (`retrieved` vs `non-retrieved` functions)
- Struct & enum examples (`person`, `car`, `contact info`)
- Arrays and search operations
- String manipulation and input handling
- Type casting and conversions

## ✅ Conclusion

By the end of this course, I:

1. Learned how to **translate algorithmic thinking into C++ code**
2. Practiced **structured programming** with functions, loops, and conditionals
3. Understood **data types, structures, enums, and scope**
4. Applied **casting and string manipulation** for real input/output
5. Gained confidence to solve problems in C++ with proper organization
6. Built a foundation for **advanced C++ programming and algorithmic problem solving**

> This course bridges the gap between thinking skills (from Algorithms Level 1) and real programming, preparing me for more complex projects and C++ challenges.
