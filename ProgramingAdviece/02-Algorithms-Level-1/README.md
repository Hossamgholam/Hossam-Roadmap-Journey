# Algorithms & Problem Solving – Level 1

##  Course Objective

This course focuses entirely on building algorithmic thinking before learning any programming language.

The goal is to learn how to:
- Analyze problems
- Break them into logical steps
- Design structured solutions
- Think before coding

---

##  Core Concepts Learned

- What is an Algorithm?
- Input → Process → Output model
- Logical decision making
- Step-by-step reasoning
- Flowchart design
- Breaking problems into smaller parts

---

##  Problem Solving Framework I Learned

For every problem, I follow this structure:

1️⃣ Understand the problem  
2️⃣ Identify inputs  
3️⃣ Identify expected outputs  
4️⃣ Break solution into steps  
5️⃣ Handle conditions (decisions)  
6️⃣ Represent solution using a flowchart  

---

##  Structure of Practice

This course includes 50 carefully selected problems focused on:

- Basic calculations
- Conditions (if/else logic)
- Loops thinking (conceptually)
- Step-by-step reasoning
- Logical branching

No programming language was used.
Only structured thinking and flowcharts.

##  What I Gained

- Strong logical thinking foundation
- Ability to analyze problems before coding
- Confidence in designing structured solutions
- Reduced trial-and-error thinking
- Mental preparation for C++ problem solving
