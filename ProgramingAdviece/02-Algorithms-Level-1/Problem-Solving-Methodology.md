# My Problem Solving Methodology

Through this course, I learned that problem solving follows a structured mental process.

## Step 1: Understand the Problem
Read carefully.
Avoid jumping into solutions.

## Step 2: Define Inputs
What data do I receive?

## Step 3: Define Outputs
What result is expected?

## Step 4: Design the Logic
Break the solution into small clear steps.

## Step 5: Handle Decisions
If there are conditions, define them clearly.

## Step 6: Visualize Using Flowchart
Use visual representation to confirm logic correctness.

## Example

### Problem:
Calculate the average of 3 numbers.

### Input:
Number1, Number2, Number3

### Process:
Sum = Number1 + Number2 + Number3  
Average = Sum / 3

### Output:
Average value

This structured thinking prevents random coding and logical mistakes.
