# 04 – Advanced Problem Solving – Level 1

## 📌 Course Overview

In this course, I revisited the 50 algorithmic problems from the previous Algorithms course, but this time I solved them using C++.

The goal was not learning new syntax — but improving:

- Logical thinking
- Code structuring
- Translating algorithms into real programs
- Avoiding trial-and-error coding

---

## 🧠 What Improved in This Course

- Writing cleaner structured solutions
- Breaking complex problems into smaller functions
- Using loops and conditions more effectively
- Applying previous algorithmic thinking in real code
- Improving debugging and logical correction skills

---

## 🔁 Difference from Previous Courses

Algorithms Level 1:
- Thinking without code

C++ Level 1:
- Learning syntax and basic programming

Advanced Problem Solving:
- Combining thinking + C++
- Solving problems efficiently and correctly

---

## 🎯 Key Outcome

This course strengthened my ability to:

- Think before coding
- Structure solutions properly
- Apply algorithmic reasoning using C++
- Solve problems with confidence
