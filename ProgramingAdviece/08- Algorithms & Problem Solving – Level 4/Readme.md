#  Algorithms & Problem Solving – Level 4 (C++)

##  Overview

This course represents advanced-scale algorithmic practice.

After completing Algorithms Level 3, this stage focused on:

- Endurance in problem solving  
- Handling larger structured logic  
- Managing complexity across long implementations  
- Thinking in system-level design  

I solved 65 advanced problems and implemented larger structured logic that simulates real-world systems.

This level is about discipline, scale, and programming maturity.

## 🔹 Core Focus of This Level

Unlike previous levels, this course emphasized:

- Writing longer structured implementations
- Maintaining clean architecture across large code
- Applying Divide & Conquer at scale
- Handling edge cases carefully
- Building reusable logic modules

---

##  Major Implementation: Date & Period Engine

One of the most advanced parts of this level was building a full `clsDate` system including:

###  Date Core Features

- Detect leap year
- Get number of:
  - Days / Hours / Minutes / Seconds in year
  - Days / Hours / Minutes / Seconds in month
- Convert day order to date
- Calculate day of week
- Print monthly and yearly calendar
- Convert date to string
- Validate date

---

###  Date Comparison Logic

- Check if date1 is before date2
- Check equality
- Check if date1 is after date2
- Compare using enum (before / equal / after)
- Check if date is between two dates

---

###  Date Arithmetic (Increase / Decrease)

Implemented full date manipulation system:

- Add one day
- Add X days
- Add weeks
- Add months
- Add years
- Add decades / centuries / millennium

Also implemented:

- Decrease day / week / month / year
- Decrease decades / centuries / millennium

This required careful handling of:

- Leap years
- Month boundaries
- Year transitions
- End-of-month correction logic

---

###  Business Logic Calculations

- Calculate difference in days between two dates
- Calculate age in days
- Detect weekend
- Detect business day
- Calculate business days between two dates
- Calculate vacation return date
- Days until end of month
- Days until end of year

---

###  Period Handling

Implemented period-based logic:

- Check if two periods overlap
- Calculate period length in days
- Check if date is within a period

This simulates real-world scheduling and HR-style systems.

---

###  Input Validation Utilities

Built reusable input functions:

- Safe integer input
- Safe double input
- Input range validation
- Generic template function for range checking

This strengthened defensive programming practices.

##  Skills Gained

By completing Level 4, I improved:

- Managing large structured classes
- Designing reusable utility systems
- Handling edge cases under complexity
- Writing scalable clean logic
- System-level thinking
- Business-rule implementation
- Real-world style problem solving

Most importantly:

> I can now maintain structure and clarity  
> even in long and complex implementations.

---

##  Course Outcome

Algorithms Level 4 transformed practice into real programming maturity.

This level prepared me for:

- Larger backend systems
- Business rule engines
- Real-world date/time handling logic
- Professional-level structured programming

This stage represents a shift from solving problems  
to building scalable logic systems.
