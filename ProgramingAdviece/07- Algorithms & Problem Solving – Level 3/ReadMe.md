# 📘 Algorithms & Problem Solving – Level 3 (C++)

##  Overview

This course represents a major step in my programming journey.  
After completing previous levels in algorithms and C++, this stage focused on **deep practice, structured thinking, and real programming maturity**.

Instead of learning new syntax, the goal was to strengthen problem-solving skills through harder problems and practical mini-systems.

I solved 51 programming problems with increasing difficulty and applied everything I learned in previous courses.

## 🔹 Core Areas Covered

###  Matrix Operations
Implemented multiple utility functions for 2D arrays:

- Fill matrix with random values
- Sum rows and columns
- Store row/column sums in arrays
- Compare matrices (by sum and element-by-element)
- Check for:
  - Identity matrix
  - Scalar matrix
- Count occurrences of a number
- Check if a value exists
- Find min and max values
- Check palindrome rows

These exercises strengthened:
- Nested loop logic
- 2D array manipulation
- Logical condition control
- Functional decomposition

###  Advanced String Manipulation

Built a complete string utility module including:

- Capitalize first letter of each word
- Lowercase first letter of each word
- Convert full string to upper/lower case
- Invert letter case
- Count:
  - Capital letters
  - Small letters
  - Specific letters (case sensitive / insensitive)
  - Vowels
  - Words
- Split string using custom delimiter
- Join vector/array into string
- Trim left / right / full trim
- Replace words (case sensitive / insensitive)
- Remove punctuation

These problems improved:
- Text processing skills
- Working with `vector<string>`
- Function overloading
- Enums and optional parameters
- Clean modular design

###  Record & Data Handling (Struct Simulation)

Implemented structured client records:

```cpp
struct client {
    string account_number;
    string pincode;
    string name;
    string phone;
    float accountbalance;
};
```

Built logic to:

- Convert struct → record line (custom delimiter)
- Split record line → vector
- Convert vector → struct
- Print structured data

This simulates real-world database record processing.

###  CRUD Operations Simulation

Implemented basic data management operations:

- Add client
- Find client
- Update client
- Delete client

This was an important transition from solving isolated problems  
to building structured mini-systems.

##  Projects Built During This Course

During this stage, I also built two practical console-based projects applying the same concepts learned here.

These projects are available in a separate repository:

🔗 **Core Concepts Projects (C++)**  
- [[Bank-Extention1](https://github.com/Hossamgholam/CPP-Core-Concepts-Projects/tree/8b21c2edfeb2bb789dad73a5fe70549840dc3707/basics/Bank/Extention1)]
- [[Bank-Extention2](https://github.com/Hossamgholam/CPP-Core-Concepts-Projects/tree/8b21c2edfeb2bb789dad73a5fe70549840dc3707/basics/Bank/Extention2)]

They reflect my transition from solving exercises to building complete applications.

##  Skills Gained

By the end of this course, I improved:

- Algorithmic thinking speed
- Clean function design
- Code organization
- Structured data handling
- Real-world simulation mindset
- Confidence in medium-complex systems

Most importantly:

> I moved from thinking about syntax  
> to thinking about structure and logic.

##  Conclusion

Algorithms Level 3 transformed accumulated knowledge  
into real programming experience.

This stage strengthened my foundation and prepared me  
for larger systems and more advanced development stages.
