# 🌐 Network & System Fundamentals – Level 2  
### Understanding How Systems Communicate Behind the Code

---

## 🗝️ About This Course

This course is placed intentionally at this stage of the roadmap.

It comes after completing a disciplined programming foundation:

1️⃣ Programming Foundations – Level 1  
2️⃣ Algorithms & Problem Solving – Level 1  
3️⃣ Introduction to Programming with C++ – Level 1  
4️⃣ Algorithms & Problem Solving – Clean Code Solutions  
5️⃣ Algorithms & Problem Solving – Level 2  
6️⃣ Programming Using C++ – Level 2  
7️⃣ Algorithms & Problem Solving – Level 3  
8️⃣ Algorithms & Problem Solving – Level 4  
9️⃣ Foundations – Level 2  

By this point in the journey:

- Writing code is no longer confusing.
- Problem solving is structured and disciplined.
- Functions and procedures are natural tools.
- Program flow and memory behavior are understood.
- Small systems and utilities have already been built.

This course is not about writing more code.

It is about understanding the environment where code actually runs.

It expands the perspective from:

Writing programs  
to  
Understanding systems.

# 🎯 Why This Course Matters

Modern backend development is not only about writing code.

It requires understanding:

- How data travels
- How servers operate
- How protocols structure communication
- How applications connect to databases
- How architecture separates responsibilities

This course builds that awareness.
