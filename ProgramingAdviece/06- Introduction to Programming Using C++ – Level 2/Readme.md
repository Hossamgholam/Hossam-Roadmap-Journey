# Introduction to Programming Using C++ – Level 2

## 📌 Course Overview

This course represents a major turning point in my C++ learning journey.

After completing:

1. Programming Foundations – Level 1  
2. Algorithms & Problem Solving – Level 1  
3. C++ Level 1  
4. Clean Code Problem Solving  
5. Algorithms & Problem Solving – Level 2  

I had strong logical thinking and clean coding ability.

This course moved me from:

> Writing working programs  
to  
> Understanding exactly why programs work.

It focuses on advanced C++ concepts such as debugging, memory management, pointers, references, dynamic allocation, vectors, file handling, and date/time handling.

This is where C++ became a real power tool.

## 🧠 What This Course Introduced

### 🔹 Professional Debugging

- Using breakpoints
- Inspecting memory values
- Step Into / Step Over / Step Out
- Quick Watch & Auto Window
- Understanding execution flow clearly

Debugging became a skill — not just a tool.

---

### 🔹 Advanced Function Concepts

- Function declaration vs definition
- Default parameters
- Function overloading
- Recursion and call stack behavior
- Understanding active frames in memory

I now understand how the call stack works internally.

---

### 🔹 Deep Understanding of Variables & Memory

- Static variables
- Global variables
- Automatic variables
- Stack vs Heap
- Variable lifetime & storage duration

I no longer guess where data lives in memory — I understand it.

---

### 🔹 Pointers & References

- Pointer declaration and dereferencing
- Pointer arithmetic
- Pointers with arrays and structures
- Void pointers
- Differences between references and pointers

This removed the fear of pointers completely.

---

### 🔹 Dynamic Memory Allocation

- Using `new` and `delete`
- Dynamic arrays
- Managing heap memory safely
- Understanding memory leaks

This was a critical step toward professional programming.

---

### 🔹 Vectors (Dynamic Arrays)

- Declaration and usage
- push_back / pop_back
- size / capacity
- Iterators
- Range-based loops
- Passing vectors by reference

This prepared me for real data structure usage.

---

### 🔹 File Handling

- Write mode
- Append mode
- Read mode
- Loading file data into vectors
- Updating and deleting records
- Converting file data to structured data

Now I can build applications that persist data.

---

### 🔹 Exception Handling

- Runtime vs logical errors
- try / catch blocks
- Handling unexpected failures safely

---

### 🔹 String Manipulation

- append, insert, substr
- find and npos
- push_back / pop_back
- Character classification (isdigit, isupper, etc.)

---

### 🔹 Date & Time Handling

- Local time vs UTC
- time_t
- tm structure
- Extracting year, month, day, hour, minute, second

---

## 🎯 What I Gained From This Course

After completing this course, I can:

- Debug programs professionally
- Understand memory behavior clearly
- Use pointers and dynamic memory safely
- Build file-based applications
- Control program execution flow
- Understand stack vs heap deeply
- Prepare confidently for OOP and large systems

---

## 📍 Position in My Learning Journey

This course represents the stage where:

> I stopped writing code blindly and started controlling execution, memory, and behavior.

It bridges problem-solving skills with system-level understanding.

Now I am prepared for:

- Object-Oriented Programming
- Larger system design
- Advanced C++ topics
- Learning any other language easily
