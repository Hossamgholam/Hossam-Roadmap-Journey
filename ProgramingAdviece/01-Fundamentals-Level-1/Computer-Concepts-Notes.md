# Computer Concepts – Deep Notes

## 1️⃣ From Data to Wisdom

### Data
Raw facts without meaning.
Example: 85, 90, 78

### Information
Processed data that has context.
Example: These numbers are student grades.

### Knowledge
Understanding patterns and relationships.
Example: The student’s average performance is good.

### Wisdom
Making correct decisions based on knowledge.
Example: The student should focus more on weak subjects to improve further.

## 2️⃣ What is a Computer?

A computer is an electronic machine that processes data using the IPO model:

Input → Process → Output

Example:
- Input: Typing numbers in a calculator
- Process: Performing addition
- Output: Displaying the result

## 3️⃣ Main Functions of a Computer

1. Input  
2. Storage  
3. Processing  
4. Output  
5. Control  

The Control Unit coordinates all operations inside the CPU.

## 4️⃣ How a Computer Executes a Program

1. A programmer writes source code using a high-level language.
2. The compiler translates it into machine code.
3. The executable file (.exe) is stored on secondary storage (Hard Disk).
4. When the program runs:
   - The operating system loads it into RAM.
   - The CPU fetches instructions from memory.
   - The Control Unit decodes instructions.
   - The ALU performs calculations.
   - Results are stored back in memory.
   - Output is displayed to the user.

This process is called the Fetch–Decode–Execute cycle.

## 5️⃣ CPU Components

- Control Unit (CU): Directs operations.
- ALU (Arithmetic Logic Unit): Performs calculations.
- Registers: Very small, very fast memory inside CPU.
- Cache: Faster memory that stores frequently used data.

## 6️⃣ Why Computers Use Binary

Computers use binary because transistors inside hardware have only two states:

- ON (1)
- OFF (0)

Electrical voltage levels represent these states.

This makes binary the most reliable system for electronic circuits.

## 7️⃣ Number Systems

- Binary (Base 2)
- Octal (Base 8)
- Decimal (Base 10)
- Hexadecimal (Base 16)

Conversion between number systems is essential for understanding memory representation.

---

## 8️⃣ ASCII vs Unicode

ASCII:
- 7 or 8 bits
- Limited character set

Unicode:
- Supports almost all world languages
- Encodings: UTF-8, UTF-16, UTF-32

---

## 9️⃣ 32-bit vs 64-bit Architecture

32-bit systems can address up to 4GB of RAM.
64-bit systems can address much larger memory space.

---

## 🔟 Compiler vs Interpreter

Compiler:
- Translates entire source code at once.
- Produces executable file.
- Faster execution.

Interpreter:
- Translates and executes line by line.
- No separate executable file.
- Slower but easier for debugging.
