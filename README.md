## 📌 About This Repository

This repository represents my complete programming journey —  
from computer science fundamentals to backend development and system design.

It is not just a collection of code.  
It is a **structured roadmap** documenting what I studied, understood, and implemented.

The goal is to build deep technical understanding step by step —  
not just write code, but understand how systems work internally.

# 🧠 Learning Philosophy

I believe:

> If I cannot explain it clearly, I do not understand it deeply.

That’s why every course includes:
- Notes
- Organized explanations
- Implementations
- Reflection on what changed in my thinking

# 🔥 How This Supports My Backend Journey

Understanding:

- How data travels (TCP/IP, HTTP)
- How servers communicate
- How ports and sockets work
- How 3-tier architecture separates concerns
- How databases interact with applications

Makes backend development much stronger and more structured.
